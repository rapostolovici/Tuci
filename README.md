This is a project for the Life in Space Astro Pi Mission Space Lab challenge.

The purpose of the project is to see if the Raspberry PI device is working as expected in space and it is not affected by other things like radiation.

During the experiment, for 3 hours, we are reading the humidity and running some computations with big numbers. 
We are checking if the results are the same as we expect them to be (as computed on Earth).

In case of any errors, we are counting the errors and at the end of the experiment we generate a csv file with the results.
